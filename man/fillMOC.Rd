\title{Fill Matrix-Of-Clusters}
\usage{
fillMOC(clLabels, computeAccuracy = FALSE, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{clLabels}{N X M matrix containing cluster labels. Element (n,m) contains the cluster label
for element data point n in cluster m.}

\item{computeAccuracy}{Boolean. If TRUE, for each missing element, the performance of the
predictive model used to estimate the corresponding missing label is computer.}

\item{verbose}{Boolean. If TRUE, for each NA, the size of the matrix used to estimate its values is printed
to screen}
}
\value{
The output is the same matrix of clusters, where NAs have been replaced by their estimates,
where possible. If `computeAccuracy` is TRUE, then also an object called `accuracy` is returned,
where each
}
\description{
This function fills in a matrix of clusters that contains NAs, by estimating the missing cluster labels
based on the available ones.
