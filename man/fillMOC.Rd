\title{Fill Matrix-Of-Clusters}
\usage{
fillMOC(clLabels, data, computeAccuracy = FALSE, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{clLabels}{N X M matrix containing cluster labels. Element (n,m)
contains the cluster label for element data point n in cluster m.}

\item{data}{List of M datasets to be used for the label imputation.}

\item{computeAccuracy}{Boolean. If TRUE, for each missing element, the
performance of the predictive model used to estimate the corresponding
missing label is computer. Default is FALSE.}

\item{verbose}{Boolean. If TRUE, for each NA, the size of the matrix used to
estimate its values is printed to screen. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
The output is a list containing:
\item{fullClLabels}{the same matrix of clusters as the input matrix
\code{clLabels}, where NAs have been replaced by their estimates, where
possible.}
\item{nRows}{matrix where the item in position \code{(i,j)} indicates the
number of observations used in the predictive model used to estimate  the
corresponding missing label in the \code{fullClLabels} matrix.}
\item{nColumns}{number of covariates used in the predictive model used to
estimate each missing label.}
\item{accuracy}{a matrix where each element
corresponds to the predictive accuracy of the predictive model used to
estimate the corresponding label in the cluster label matrix. This is only
returned if the argument \code{computeAccuracy} is set to \code{TRUE}.}
\item{accuracy_random}{This is computed in the same way as \code{accuracy},
but with the labels randomly shuffled. This can be used in order to compare
the predictive accuracy of the imputation algorithm and is returned only if
the argument \code{computeAccuracy} is set to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\description{
This function fills in a matrix of clusters that contains NAs, by estimating
the missing cluster labels based on the available ones or based on the other
datasets. The predictive accuracy of this method can also be estimated via
cross-validation.

# Build matrix of clusters

# Extract matrix of clusters

# Extract full matrix of cluster labels
