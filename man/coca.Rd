\title{Cluster-Of-Clusters Analysis}
\usage{
coca(dataset, K, B = 1000, pItem = 0.8, hclustMethod = "average")
}
\arguments{
\item{K}{number of clusters.}

\item{B}{number of iterations of the Consensus Cluster step.}

\item{pItem}{proportion of items sampled at each iteration of the Consensus Cluster step.}

\item{hclustMethod}{method to be used by the hclust function for the hierarchical clustering step.}

\item{data}{N X C data matrix, where C is the total number of clusters considered.}
}
\value{
The output is a consensus matrix, that is a symmetric matrix where the element in position (i,j) corresponds to
the proportion of times that items i and j have been clustered together and a vector of cluster labels.
}
\description{
This function allows to do Cluster-Of-Clusters-Analysis on a binary matrix where each column is a clustering of the data,
each row corresponds to a data point and the element in position (i,j) is equal to 1 if data point i belongs to cluster
j, 0 otherwise.
