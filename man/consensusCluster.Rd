\title{Consensus clustering with k-means}
\usage{
consensusCluster(data, K, B = 100, pItem = 0.8, clMethod = "km",
  distHC = "euclidean")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{N X P data matrix}

\item{K}{number of clusters}

\item{B}{of iterations}

\item{pItem}{proportion of items sampled at each iteration}

\item{clMethod}{clustering method}
}
\value{
The output is a consensus matrix, that is a symmetric matrix where the element in position (i,j) corresponds to
the proportion of times that items i and j have been clustered together.
}
\description{
This function allows to perform consensus clustering using the k-means clustering algorithm, for a fixed number
of clusters. Contrarily to what was suggested in the original paper by Monti et al. (2003), here we consider the number
clusters K to be fixed, for simplicity.
